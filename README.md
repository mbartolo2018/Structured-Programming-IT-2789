# Structured-Programming-IT-2789
/************ IT 2789 **********************************************************************************
	*****************************************************************************************************
	** **
	** This program was prepared as part of the requirements for IT 2789, Structured Programming. **
	** **
	** COURSE DESCRIPTION: **
	** This is the second of a three course programming sequence. IT 2789, Structured Programming, builds on the **
	** concepts learned in IT 2100, Programming Logic. Programming Logic introduces programming concepts without **
	** any coding syntax. **
	** **
	** Structured Programming expands the student’s knowledge of programming concepts in the context of a **
	** programming language and its integrated development environment. It expands the student’s knowledge of **
	** algorithm design while introducing structured/modular programming in the context of a programming language. **
	** It explores implementing the basic programming concepts of variables (primitive and abstract), data types, strings, **
	** arithmetic and logical operators, decisions, and loops. **
	** **
	** In this course the student begin implementing algorithms. Students learn to develop applications in ways that **
	** facilitate program maintenance by producing self-documenting code as well as using program comments properly. **
	** **
	** In addition, this course continues to develop basic problem solving analysis and critical thinking skills that aid the **
	** student when developing algorithms. **
	** **
	** This course does not include Object Oriented Programming, which is included in the next course in the sequence. **
	** **
	** This course does not include the use of Graphical User Interfaces, which is included in the next course in the **
	** sequence. **

	** ASSIGNMENT: **
	** **
	** There are three basic programming structures; sequence, decisions, and loops. In addition, encapsulation1 is **
	** essential to creating maintainable software. This project allows the you to demonstrate your mastery of sequence, **
	** decision, loops, and encapsulation. In addition, you will demonstrate your ability to manipulate the array data **
	** structure. **
	** **
	** Design and create a program that takes a numeric input representing a number from one to six digits, with or **
	** without a decimal value (max one place to the right of the decimal point) and converts it into English text. **
	** **
	** Examples: **
	** A. 1000.0 becomes “one thousand” D. 52.5 becomes “fifty-two point five” **
	** B. 1 “becomes” one E. 0.9 or .9 becomes “point nine” or “zero point nine” **
	** C. 999.9 becomes “nine-hundred ninety-nine point nine” **
	** the hyphen in “ninety-nine” or other numbers is optional **
	** **
	** This will be a console solution, so you must devote proper effort to creating an unambiguous user interface as part **
	** of an excellent user experience. This includes checking for invalid inputs and handling them to maintain the good **
	** user experience. **
	** **
	** This program will be created using the Java programming language as your tool and eclipse as your IDE. You may **
	** not use any code you do not personally create or libraries external to Java or eclipse (i.e. nothing from other **
	** developers or the web). **
	** **
	** Since you have already learned that a developer must design before implementation, design a solution to this **
	** problem. Then, create well written program, implemented in a single class, that is maintainable by properly **
	** employing encapsulation and self-documenting code that provides the required functionality. **
